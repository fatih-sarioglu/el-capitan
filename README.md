# El Capitan
El Capitan is a simple mobile game project that I completed during my freshman year of college. This project holds a special place in my heart as it marks the first project I completed entirely on my own. While it may not be the most sophisticated game out there, it was a significant learning experience and a milestone in my journey as a game developer. I designed all the 3D objects and written all the code myself.

You can watch a short demo of the game below:
